# challenge-4
timed quiz

## Description
The motivation for this project was to see how I stacked up against my classmates in simple questions pertaining to web development. You are able to use this quiz without downloading anything additional. You will be presented with questions and once you start the time will start ticking down from 75. An incorrect response will deduct time from the timer. Once you have completed the quiz or the time reaches zero, you will be able to add a name to your high score. You can clear the high scores from the high score page.
